    "The Annotation in matplotlib supports several types of coordinates as\n",
    "described in `annotations-tutorial`. For an advanced user who wants\n",
    "more control, it supports a few other options.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. :class:`~matplotlib.transforms.Transform` instance. For example, ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      ax.annotate(\"Test\", xy=(0.5, 0.5), xycoords=ax.transAxes)\n",
    "\n",
    "    is identical to ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      ax.annotate(\"Test\", xy=(0.5, 0.5), xycoords=\"axes fraction\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    With this, you can annotate a point in other axes. ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      ax1, ax2 = subplot(121), subplot(122)\n",
    "      ax2.annotate(\"Test\", xy=(0.5, 0.5), xycoords=ax1.transData,\n",

    "                   arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"->\"))\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. :class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist` instance. The xy value (or\n",
    "    xytext) is interpreted as a fractional coordinate of the bbox\n",
    "    (return value of *get_window_extent*) of the artist. ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      an1 = ax.annotate(\"Test 1\", xy=(0.5, 0.5), xycoords=\"data\",\n",

    "\n",
    "    Note that it is your responsibility that the extent of the\n",
    "    coordinate artist (*an1* in above example) is determined before *an2*\n",
    "    gets drawn. In most cases, it means that *an2* needs to be drawn\n",
    "    later than *an1*.\n",

    " 3. A callable object that returns an instance of either\n",
    "    :class:`~matplotlib.transforms.BboxBase` or\n",
    "    :class:`~matplotlib.transforms.Transform`. If a transform is\n",
    "    returned, it is the same as 1 and if a bbox is returned, it is the same\n",
    "    as 2.  The callable object should take a single argument of the\n",
    "    renderer instance. For example, the following two commands give\n",
    "    identical results ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      an2 = ax.annotate(\"Test 2\", xy=(1, 0.5), xycoords=an1,\n",
    "                        xytext=(30,0), textcoords=\"offset points\")\n",
    "      an2 = ax.annotate(\"Test 2\", xy=(1, 0.5), xycoords=an1.get_window_extent,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. A tuple of two coordinate specifications. The first item is for the\n",
    "    x-coordinate and the second is for the y-coordinate. For example, ::\n",
    "\n",
    "      annotate(\"Test\", xy=(0.5, 1), xycoords=(\"data\", \"axes fraction\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.5 is in data coordinates, and 1 is in normalized axes coordinates.\n",

    "Using ConnectionPatch\n",
    "---------------------\n",
